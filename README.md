# RedDigitizer++

A [CAEN](https://www.caen.it/) C++ wrapper for their C API.

CAEN is an italian company that produces digitizer, power supplies, 
amplifiers, and many others types of electronics for particle/nuclear physics.

Their code is great, but it is not beginner friendly. This 
header-only library will help with that. It uses C++17, and it is written for 
readability and memory safety.

This code also contains several examples that can be used to inspire your 
own code writing.
